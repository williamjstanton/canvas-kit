# LLM Accessibility Guide

## Overview

We've created a comprehensive **LLM Accessibility Instruction File** specifically designed for use
with AI-based code assistants such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/),
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and other LLM tools.

This guide contains detailed accessibility patterns, ARIA implementation guidelines, keyboard
navigation standards, and Canvas Kit-specific accessibility best practices formatted for optimal LLM
consumption.

> **Important:** LLMs can make mistakes. Always verify accessibility implementations using this
> guide and test with actual assistive technologies (screen readers, keyboard-only navigation).

## What's Included

This LLM instruction file covers:

- **Core Accessibility Philosophy** - Canvas Kit's approach to accessible components
- **ARIA Patterns** - Complete implementation patterns for common components
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Standard keyboard shortcuts and focus management
- **Screen Reader Support** - Expected announcements and semantic markup
- **Canvas Kit Components** - AccessibleHide, AriaLiveRegion, and accessibility features built into
  components
- **Common Pitfalls** - Mistakes to avoid and how to fix them
- **Testing Guidelines** - Checklist for keyboard, screen reader, and visual testing
- **Code Examples** - Before/after comparisons for accessibility improvements

## How to Use with AI Assistants

### With Cursor

1. Download the `llm-accessibility-guide.txt` file
2. Open Cursor Settings
3. Navigate to "Features" > "Docs"
4. Add the file to your workspace context
5. Reference it in prompts: "Following the Canvas Kit accessibility guide, add keyboard navigation
   to this component"

### With Other LLM Tools

1. Download the file
2. Include the content in your prompts or project context
3. Reference specific sections when asking for accessibility improvements
4. Use as a reference for code reviews

## Key Principles

### No ARIA is Better than Bad ARIA

Canvas Kit follows the W3C principle that incorrect ARIA is worse than no ARIA at all. Always:

1. **Use semantic HTML first** - Native elements have built-in accessibility
2. **Add ARIA only when necessary** - When semantic HTML is insufficient
3. **Test thoroughly** - Verify with actual screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Canvas Kit Handles Accessibility

Most Canvas Kit components handle accessibility automatically:

```tsx
// ✅ Menu automatically provides ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
<Menu>
  <Menu.Target>
    <PrimaryButton>Actions</PrimaryButton>
  </Menu.Target>
  <Menu.Popper>
    <Menu.Card>
      <Menu.List>
        <Menu.Item>Edit</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item>Delete</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.List>
    </Menu.Card>
  </Menu.Popper>
</Menu>

// ✅ FormField automatically associates labels, hints, and errors
<FormField>
  <FormField.Label>Email</FormField.Label>
  <FormField.Input as={TextInput} />
  <FormField.Hint>We'll never share your email</FormField.Hint>
</FormField>
```

## Quick Reference

### Common Accessibility Tasks

**Add label to icon-only button:**

```tsx
<IconButton icon={closeIcon} aria-label="Close dialog" />
```

**Make dynamic content announced by screen readers:**

```tsx
import {AriaLiveRegion} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';

<AriaLiveRegion>{statusMessage}</AriaLiveRegion>;
```

**Hide content visually but keep for screen readers:**

```tsx
import {AccessibleHide} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';

<button>
  <SystemIcon icon={searchIcon} />
  <AccessibleHide>Search</AccessibleHide>
</button>;
```

## Testing Your Implementation

After using the LLM guide to implement accessibility features, always test:

### Keyboard Testing

- [ ] Navigate using `Tab` key only
- [ ] All interactive elements are reachable
- [ ] All actions can be performed without mouse
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] No keyboard traps

### Screen Reader Testing

- [ ] Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac)
- [ ] All elements have appropriate accessible names
- [ ] Dynamic changes are announced when appropriate
- [ ] Navigation is logical and intuitive

### Browser DevTools

- [ ] Use Chrome DevTools Accessibility panel
- [ ] Verify ARIA attributes are correct
- [ ] Check accessibility tree structure
- [ ] Confirm contrast ratios meet WCAG standards

**Remember:** Accessibility is not optional. It's a fundamental requirement for building inclusive
web applications. The LLM guide is a tool to help you implement accessibility correctly, but always
verify with real users and assistive technologies.
